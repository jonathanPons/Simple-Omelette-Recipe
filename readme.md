1st- Choose the color of the main background
2st- Integrate image and text
3st- Compose all parts of the text, choose the font and sizes
4st- To integrate CSS Grid and flexbox



### Built with
-Integrate an image, create folders using Git Bash.
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- litle bit @media 



### What I learned


I discovered the :last-child and ::before properties.

I worked on lists and numbered lists.
I worked on borders in flexboxes. It's always good to revisit them because I tend to forget quickly.
It took me about 7 hours to complete this project.
